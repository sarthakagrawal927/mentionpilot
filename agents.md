# agents.md — mentionpilot

## Purpose
Brand mention monitoring for AI assistants — tracks how ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity reference brands, with GEO optimization tools, social monitoring, and an embeddable badge widget.

## Stack
- Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) — `apps/web`; Hono CF Worker — `workers/api`
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4
- DB: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) + Drizzle — schema in `packages/db`
- Auth: NextAuth v5 beta (Google OAuth)
- Testing: Playwright (e2e, `apps/web`), Vitest (`workers/api`)
- Deploy: Vercel (web) + Cloudflare Workers (API)
- Package manager: pnpm workspace

pnpm dev:web        # Next.js only
pnpm dev:api        # CF Worker only (wrangler dev)
pnpm build          # Build all packages
pnpm test           # All tests
pnpm typecheck      # TS check across workspace
pnpm lint           # Lint across workspace

# Deploy API
cd workers/api && pnpm deploy   # wrangler deploy

# Badge widget
bash scripts/build-badge.sh
```

## Architecture notes
- **pnpm workspace monorepo**: `apps/*`, `packages/*`, `workers/*`.
- **D1 migrations** in `packages/db/migrations/`; `wrangler.toml` points there via `migrations_dir`.
- **Daily cron**: Worker checks AI mentions at 06:00 UTC and stores results in D1.
- **AI provider config**: `FREE_AI_ENDPOINT_URL`, `FREE_AI_API_KEY`, `FREE_AI_MODEL` set in CF dashboard — never hardcoded.
- **Badge widget**: self-contained Vite build, `dist/` is the publish artifact. Embeddable "mentioned by AI" badge for customers.
- **Velite**: used in `apps/web` for MDX content processing (blog/docs).
- **IMPORTANT**: `@saas-maker/ai` is referenced via local file path (`/Users/sarthakagrawal/Desktop/saas-maker/packages/ai`) — will break on other machines.
- Pre-push hook via Husky.

## Idea Backlog — LLM SEO extension (source: `~/Desktop/reference/saas-ideas/README.md` line 85)

### Scope: `llms.txt` advisor + LLM-SEO planner
- Generate `llms.txt` for client sites — prioritize what LLM crawlers should see
- Score how well the site is indexed across ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Perplexity (existing mention pipeline already does this)
- Suggest concrete fixes — canonical pages to expose, structured summaries, FAQ blocks, schema markup
- Diff scans week-over-week → recurring revenue surface

### How it complements current brand-mention monitor
- Mention monitor = OUTPUT: am I cited by LLMs?
- `llms.txt` advisor = INPUT: what does the LLM see when it crawls?
- Reuse: existing crawl infra, AI provider config, D1 schema (extend with `site_audits`, `llms_txt_versions`)
- Same buyer, additive ARPU

### Build order
1. `llms.txt` generator from site crawl (sitemap + content classification)
2. Audit report: missing canonical summaries, weak FAQ coverage, broken structured data
3. Recurring scan + diff dashboard
4. Bundle with existing badge widget — "AI-Optimized" trust signal
